# Licence to Fab

We aren’t really a design firm or a manufacturer, we aren’t even really a company. What we are is a group of people who believe that using rigorous engineering and science, we can build a cleaner future. We have a passion for speed, and an understanding that this does not have to clash with our goals to be a carbon negative society. And through motorsport we seek to push renewable technologies to the limit, to develop the power unit of the future. We want this power unit to be affordable, fully open-source, and be proven on the most aggressive testbed known to humankind—the racetrack.

We are Licence to Fab, and we’re fabricating the first ever open-source, Hydrogen fueled engine ever made. We hope you join us on our mission to build a cleaner future.
